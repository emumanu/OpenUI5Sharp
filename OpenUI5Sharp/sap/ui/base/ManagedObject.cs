				/// <summary>
				/// Base Class that introduces some basic concepts like state management or databinding.
				/// 
				/// New subclasses of ManagedObject are created with a call to {@link #.extend ManagedObject.extend} and can make use of the following managed features:
				/// 
				/// <h3>Properties</h3> Managed properties represent the state of a ManagedObject. They can store a single value of a simple data type (like 'string' or 'int'). They have a <i>name</i> (e.g. 'size') and methods to get the current value (<code>getSize</code>), or to set a new value (<code>setSize</code>). When a property is modified, the ManagedObject is marked as invalidated. A managed property can be bound against a property in a {@link sap.ui.model.Model} by using the {@link #bindProperty} method. Updates to the model property will be automatically reflected in the managed property and - if TwoWay databinding is active, changes to the managed property will be reflected in the model. An existing binding can be removed by calling {@link #unbindProperty}.
				/// 
				/// If a ManagedObject is cloned, the clone will have the same values for its managed properties as the source of the clone - if the property wasn't bound. If it is bound, the property in the clone will be bound to the same model property as in the source.
				/// 
				/// Details about the declaration of a managed property, the metadata that describes it and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend } method.
				/// 
				/// <h3>Aggregations</h3> Managed aggregations can store one or more references to other ManagedObjects. They are a mean to control the lifecycle of the aggregated objects: one ManagedObject can be aggregated by at most one parent ManagedObject at any time. When a ManagedObject is destroyed, all aggregated objects are destroyed as well and the object itself is removed from its parent. That is, aggregations won't contain destroyed objects or null/undefined.
				/// 
				/// Aggregations have a <i>name</i> ('e.g 'header' or 'items'), a <i>cardinality</i> ('0..1' or '0..n') and are of a specific <i>type</i> (which must be a subclass of ManagedObject as well or a UI5 interface). A ManagedObject will provide methods to set or get the aggregated object for a specific aggregation of cardinality 0..1 (e.g. <code>setHeader</code>, <code>getHeader</code> for an aggregation named 'header'). For an aggregation of cardinality 0..n, there are methods to get all aggregated objects (<code>getItems</code>), to locate an object in the aggregation (e.g. <code>indexOfItem</code>), to add, insert or remove a single aggregated object (<code>addItem</code>, <code>insertItem</code>, <code>removeItem</code>) or to remove or destroy all objects from an aggregation (<code>removeAllItems</code>, <code>destroyItems</code>).
				/// 
				/// Details about the declaration of a managed aggregation, the metadata that describes the aggregation, and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend} method.
				/// 
				/// Aggregations of cardinality 0..n can be bound to a collection in a model by using {@link #bindAggregation} (and unbound again using {@link #unbindAggregation}). For each context in the model collection, a corresponding object will be created in the managed aggregation, either by cloning a template object or by calling a factory function.
				/// 
				/// Aggregations also control the databinding context of bound objects: by default, aggregated objects inherit all models and binding contexts from their parent object.
				/// 
				/// When a ManagedObject is cloned, all aggregated objects will be cloned as well - but only if they haven't been added by databinding. In that case, the aggregation in the clone will be bound to the same model collection.
				/// 
				/// <h3>Associations</h3> Managed associations also form a relationship between objects, but they don't define a lifecycle for the associated objects. They even can 'break' in the sense that an associated object might have been destroyed already although it is still referenced in an association. For the same reason, the internal storage for associations are not direct object references but only the IDs of the associated target objects.
				/// 
				/// Associations have a <i>name</i> ('e.g 'initialFocus'), a <i>cardinality</i> ('0..1' or '0..n') and are of a specific <i>type</i> (which must be a subclass of ManagedObject as well or a UI5 interface). A ManagedObject will provide methods to set or get the associated object for a specific association of cardinality 0..1 (e.g. <code>setInitialFocus</code>, <code>getInitialFocus</code>). For an association of cardinality 0..n, there are methods to get all associated objects (<code>getRefItems</code>), to add, insert or remove a single associated object (<code>addRefItem</code>, <code>insertRefItem</code>, <code>removeRefItem</code>) or to remove all objects from an association (<code>removeAllRefItems</code>).
				/// 
				/// Details about the declaration of a managed association, the metadata that describes it and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend} method.
				/// 
				/// Associations can't be bound to the model.
				/// 
				/// When a ManagedObject is cloned, the result for an association depends on the relationship between the associated target object and the root of the clone operation. If the associated object is part of the to-be-cloned object tree (reachable via aggregations from the root of the clone operation), then the cloned association will reference the clone of the associated object. Otherwise the association will reference the same object as in the original tree. When a ManagedObject is destroyed, other objects that are only associated, are not affected by the destroy operation.
				/// 
				/// <h3>Events</h3> Managed events provide a mean for communicating important state changes to an arbitrary number of 'interested' listeners. Events have a <i>name</i> and (optionally) a set of <i>parameters</i>. For each event there will be methods to add or remove an event listener as well as a method to fire the event. (e.g. <code>attachChange</code>, <code>detachChange</code>, <code>fireChange</code> for an event named 'change').
				/// 
				/// Details about the declaration of managed events, the metadata that describes the event, and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend} method.
				/// 
				/// When a ManagedObject is cloned, all listeners registered for any event in the clone source are also registered to the clone. Later changes are not reflected in any direction (neither from source to clone, nor vice versa).
				/// 
				/// <a name="lowlevelapi"><h3>Low Level APIs:</h3></a> The prototype of ManagedObject provides several generic, low level APIs to manage properties, aggregations, associations, and events. These generic methods are solely intended for implementing higher level, non-generic methods that manage a single managed property etc. (e.g. a function <code>setSize(value)</code> that sets a new value for property 'size'). {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend} creates default implementations of those higher level APIs for all managed aspects. The implementation of a subclass then can override those default implementations with a more specific implementation, e.g. to implement a side effect when a specific property is set or retrieved. It is therefore important to understand that the generic low-level methods ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR GENERIC ACCESS to the state of a managed object, as that would bypass the overriding higher level methods and their side effects.

					/// 
					/// <b>'aggregations'</b> : <i>object</i><br> An object literal whose properties each define a new aggregation in the ManagedObject subclass. The value can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new aggregation or it can be an object literal with the following properties <ul> <li><code>type: <i>string</i></code> type of the new aggregation. must be the full global name of a ManagedObject subclass (in dot notation, e.g. 'sap.m.Button')</li> <li><code>[multiple]: <i>boolean</i></code> whether the aggregation is a 0..1 (false) or a 0..n aggregation (true), defaults to true </li> <li><code>[singularName]: <i>string</i></code>. Singular name for 0..n aggregations. For 0..n aggregations the name by convention should be the plural name. Methods affecting multiple objects in an aggregation will use the plural name (e.g. getItems(), whereas methods that deal with a single object will use the singular name (e.g. addItem). The framework knows a set of common rules for building plural form of English nouns and uses these rules to determine a singular name on its own. if that name is wrong, a singluarName can be specified with this property. </li> <li><code>[visibility]: <i>string</i></code> either 'hidden' or 'public', defaults to 'public'. Aggregations that belong to the API of a class must be 'public' whereas 'hidden' aggregations typically are used for the implementation of composite classes (e.g. composite controls) </li> <li><code>bindable: <i>boolean|string</i></code> (either can be omitted or set to the boolean value <code>true</code> or the magic string 'bindable') If set to <code>true</code> or 'bindable', additional named methods <code>bind<i>Name</i></code> and <code>unbind<i>Name</i></code> are generated as convenience. Despite its name, setting this flag is not mandatory to make the managed aggregation bindable. The generic methods {@link #bindAggregation} and {@link #unbindAggregation} can always be used. </li> <li><code>forwarding: <i>object</i></code> If set, this defines a forwarding of objects added to this aggregation into an aggregation of another ManagedObject - typically to an inner control within a composite control. This means that all adding, removal, or other operations happening on the source aggregation are actually called on the target instance. All elements added to the source aggregation will be located at the target aggregation (this means the target instance is their parent). Both, source and target element will return the added elements when asked for the content of the respective aggregation. If present, the named (non-generic) aggregation methods will be called for the target aggregation. Aggregations can only be forwarded to non-hidden aggregations of the same or higher multiplicity (i.e. an aggregation with multiplicity "0..n" cannot be forwarded to an aggregation with multiplicity "0..1"). The target aggregation must also be "compatible" to the source aggregation in the sense that any items given to the source aggregation must also be valid in the target aggregation (otherwise the target element will throw a validation error). If the forwarded elements use data binding, the target element must be properly aggregated by the source element to make sure all models are available there as well. The aggregation target must remain the same instance across the entire lifetime of the source control. Aggregation forwarding will behave unexpectedly when the content in the target aggregation is modified by other actors (e.g. by the target element or by another forwarding from a different source aggregation). Hence, this is not allowed. The forwarding configuration object defines the target of the forwarding. The available settings are: <ul> <li><code>idSuffix: <i>string</i></code>A string which is appended to the ID of <i>this</i> ManagedObject to construct the ID of the target ManagedObject. This is one of the two options to specify the target. This option requires the target instance to be created in the init() method of this ManagedObject and to be always available.</li> <li><code>getter: <i>string</i></code>The name of the function on instances of this ManagedObject which returns the target instance. This second option to specify the target can be used for lazy instantiation of the target. Note that either idSuffix or getter must be given. Also note that the target instance returned by the getter must remain the same over the entire lifetime of this ManagedObject and the implementation assumes that all instances return the same type of object (at least the target aggregation must always be defined in the same class).</li> <li><code>aggregation: <i>string</i></code>The name of the aggregation on the target into which the objects shall be forwarded. The multiplicity of the target aggregation must be the same as the one of the source aggregation for which forwarding is defined.</li> <li><code>[forwardBinding]: <i>boolean</i></code>Whether any binding should happen on the forwarding target or not. Default if omitted is <code>false</code>, which means any bindings happen on the outer ManagedObject. When the binding is forwarded, all binding methods like updateAggregation, getBindingInfo, refreshAggregation etc. are called on the target element of the forwarding instead of being called on this element. The basic aggregation mutator methods (add/remove etc.) are only called on the forwarding target element. Without forwardBinding, they are called on this element, but forwarded to the forwarding target, where they actually modify the aggregation. </li> </ul> </li> <li><code>selector: <i>string</i></code> either can be omitted or set to a valid selector string as defined by the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector Element.prototype.querySelector} method. The selector should locate the DOM element that surrounds the aggregation's content. It should only be set for aggregations that have a visual representation in the DOM. A DOM element surrounding the aggregation's rendered content should be available in the DOM, even if the aggregation is empty or not rendered for some reason. In cases where this is not possible or not intended, <code>getDomRefForSetting</code> can be overridden, see below.
					/// 
					/// In addition to the CSS selector syntax, the selector string can contain the magic token <code>{id}</code> (multiple times). Before evaluating the selector in the context of an Element or Control, all occurrences of the token have to be replaced by the (potentially escaped) ID of that Element or Control. In fact, any selector should start with <code>#{id}</code> to ensure that the query result is limited to the desired Element or Control.

Singular name for 0..n aggregations. For 0..n aggregations the name by convention should be the plural name. Methods affecting multiple objects in an aggregation will use the plural name (e.g. getItems(), whereas methods that deal with a single object will use the singular name (e.g. addItem). The framework knows a set of common rules for building plural form of English nouns and uses these rules to determine a singular name on its own. if that name is wrong, a singluarName can be specified with this property. </li> <li><code>[visibility]: <i>string</i></code> either 'hidden' or 'public', defaults to 'public'. Aggregations that belong to the API of a class must be 'public' whereas 'hidden' aggregations typically are used for the implementation of composite classes (e.g. composite controls) </li> <li><code>bindable: <i>boolean|string</i></code> (either can be omitted or set to the boolean value <code>true</code> or the magic string 'bindable') If set to <code>true</code> or 'bindable', additional named methods <code>bind<i>Name</i></code> and <code>unbind<i>Name</i></code> are generated as convenience. Despite its name, setting this flag is not mandatory to make the managed aggregation bindable. The generic methods {@link #bindAggregation} and {@link #unbindAggregation} can always be used. </li> <li><code>forwarding: <i>object</i></code> If set, this defines a forwarding of objects added to this aggregation into an aggregation of another ManagedObject - typically to an inner control within a composite control. This means that all adding, removal, or other operations happening on the source aggregation are actually called on the target instance. All elements added to the source aggregation will be located at the target aggregation (this means the target instance is their parent). Both, source and target element will return the added elements when asked for the content of the respective aggregation. If present, the named (non-generic) aggregation methods will be called for the target aggregation. Aggregations can only be forwarded to non-hidden aggregations of the same or higher multiplicity (i.e. an aggregation with multiplicity "0..n" cannot be forwarded to an aggregation with multiplicity "0..1"). The target aggregation must also be "compatible" to the source aggregation in the sense that any items given to the source aggregation must also be valid in the target aggregation (otherwise the target element will throw a validation error). If the forwarded elements use data binding, the target element must be properly aggregated by the source element to make sure all models are available there as well. The aggregation target must remain the same instance across the entire lifetime of the source control. Aggregation forwarding will behave unexpectedly when the content in the target aggregation is modified by other actors (e.g. by the target element or by another forwarding from a different source aggregation). Hence, this is not allowed. The forwarding configuration object defines the target of the forwarding. The available settings are: <ul> <li><code>idSuffix: <i>string</i></code>A string which is appended to the ID of <i>this</i> ManagedObject to construct the ID of the target ManagedObject. This is one of the two options to specify the target. This option requires the target instance to be created in the init() method of this ManagedObject and to be always available.</li> <li><code>getter: <i>string</i></code>The name of the function on instances of this ManagedObject which returns the target instance. This second option to specify the target can be used for lazy instantiation of the target. Note that either idSuffix or getter must be given. Also note that the target instance returned by the getter must remain the same over the entire lifetime of this ManagedObject and the implementation assumes that all instances return the same type of object (at least the target aggregation must always be defined in the same class).</li> <li><code>aggregation: <i>string</i></code>The name of the aggregation on the target into which the objects shall be forwarded. The multiplicity of the target aggregation must be the same as the one of the source aggregation for which forwarding is defined.</li> <li><code>[forwardBinding]: <i>boolean</i></code>Whether any binding should happen on the forwarding target or not. Default if omitted is <code>false</code>, which means any bindings happen on the outer ManagedObject. When the binding is forwarded, all binding methods like updateAggregation, getBindingInfo, refreshAggregation etc. are called on the target element of the forwarding instead of being called on this element. The basic aggregation mutator methods (add/remove etc.) are only called on the forwarding target element. Without forwardBinding, they are called on this element, but forwarded to the forwarding target, where they actually modify the aggregation. </li> </ul> </li> <li><code>selector: <i>string</i></code> either can be omitted or set to a valid selector string as defined by the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector Element.prototype.querySelector} method. The selector should locate the DOM element that surrounds the aggregation's content. It should only be set for aggregations that have a visual representation in the DOM. A DOM element surrounding the aggregation's rendered content should be available in the DOM, even if the aggregation is empty or not rendered for some reason. In cases where this is not possible or not intended, <code>getDomRefForSetting</code> can be overridden, see below.
					/// 
					/// In addition to the CSS selector syntax, the selector string can contain the magic token <code>{id}</code> (multiple times). Before evaluating the selector in the context of an Element or Control, all occurrences of the token have to be replaced by the (potentially escaped) ID of that Element or Control.

					/// <b>'aggregations'</b> : <i>object</i><br> An object literal whose properties each define a new aggregation in the ManagedObject subclass. The value can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new aggregation or it can be an object literal with the following properties <ul> <li><code>type: <i>string</i></code> type of the new aggregation. must be the full global name of a ManagedObject subclass (in dot notation, e.g. 'sap.m.Button')</li> <li><code>[multiple]: <i>boolean</i></code> whether the aggregation is a 0..1 (false) or a 0..n aggregation (true), defaults to true </li> <li><code>[singularName]: <i>string</i></code>. Singular name for 0..n aggregations. For 0..n aggregations the name by convention should be the plural name. Methods affecting multiple objects in an aggregation will use the plural name (e.g. getItems(), whereas methods that deal with a single object will use the singular name (e.g. addItem). The framework knows a set of common rules for building plural form of English nouns and uses these rules to determine a singular name on its own. if that name is wrong, a singluarName can be specified with this property. </li> <li><code>[visibility]: <i>string</i></code> either 'hidden' or 'public', defaults to 'public'. Aggregations that belong to the API of a class must be 'public' whereas 'hidden' aggregations typically are used for the implementation of composite classes (e.g. composite controls) </li> <li><code>bindable: <i>boolean|string</i></code> (either can be omitted or set to the boolean value <code>true</code> or the magic string 'bindable') If set to <code>true</code> or 'bindable', additional named methods <code>bind<i>Name</i></code> and <code>unbind<i>Name</i></code> are generated as convenience. Despite its name, setting this flag is not mandatory to make the managed aggregation bindable. The generic methods {@link #bindAggregation} and {@link #unbindAggregation} can always be used. </li> <li><code>forwarding: <i>object</i></code> If set, this defines a forwarding of objects added to this aggregation into an aggregation of another ManagedObject - typically to an inner control within a composite control. This means that all adding, removal, or other operations happening on the source aggregation are actually called on the target instance. All elements added to the source aggregation will be located at the target aggregation (this means the target instance is their parent). Both, source and target element will return the added elements when asked for the content of the respective aggregation. If present, the named (non-generic) aggregation methods will be called for the target aggregation. Aggregations can only be forwarded to non-hidden aggregations of the same or higher multiplicity (i.e. an aggregation with multiplicity "0..n" cannot be forwarded to an aggregation with multiplicity "0..1"). The target aggregation must also be "compatible" to the source aggregation in the sense that any items given to the source aggregation must also be valid in the target aggregation (otherwise the target element will throw a validation error). If the forwarded elements use data binding, the target element must be properly aggregated by the source element to make sure all models are available there as well. The aggregation target must remain the same instance across the entire lifetime of the source control. Aggregation forwarding will behave unexpectedly when the content in the target aggregation is modified by other actors (e.g. by the target element or by another forwarding from a different source aggregation). Hence, this is not allowed. The forwarding configuration object defines the target of the forwarding. The available settings are: <ul> <li><code>idSuffix: <i>string</i></code>A string which is appended to the ID of <i>this</i> ManagedObject to construct the ID of the target ManagedObject. This is one of the two options to specify the target. This option requires the target instance to be created in the init() method of this ManagedObject and to be always available.</li> <li><code>getter: <i>string</i></code>The name of the function on instances of this ManagedObject which returns the target instance. This second option to specify the target can be used for lazy instantiation of the target. Note that either idSuffix or getter must be given. Also note that the target instance returned by the getter must remain the same over the entire lifetime of this ManagedObject and the implementation assumes that all instances return the same type of object (at least the target aggregation must always be defined in the same class).</li> <li><code>aggregation: <i>string</i></code>The name of the aggregation on the target into which the objects shall be forwarded. The multiplicity of the target aggregation must be the same as the one of the source aggregation for which forwarding is defined.</li> <li><code>[forwardBinding]: <i>boolean</i></code>Whether any binding should happen on the forwarding target or not. Default if omitted is <code>false</code>, which means any bindings happen on the outer ManagedObject. When the binding is forwarded, all binding methods like updateAggregation, getBindingInfo, refreshAggregation etc. are called on the target element of the forwarding instead of being called on this element. The basic aggregation mutator methods (add/remove etc.) are only called on the forwarding target element. Without forwardBinding, they are called on this element, but forwarded to the forwarding target, where they actually modify the aggregation. </li> </ul> </li> <li><code>selector: <i>string</i></code> either can be omitted or set to a valid selector string as defined by the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector Element.prototype.querySelector} method. The selector should locate the DOM element that surrounds the aggregation's content. It should only be set for aggregations that have a visual representation in the DOM. A DOM element surrounding the aggregation's rendered content should be available in the DOM, even if the aggregation is empty or not rendered for some reason. In cases where this is not possible or not intended, <code>getDomRefForSetting</code> can be overridden, see below.
					/// 
					/// In addition to the CSS selector syntax, the selector string can contain the magic token <code>{id}</code> (multiple times). Before evaluating the selector in the context of an Element or Control, all occurrences of the token have to be replaced by the (potentially escaped) ID of that Element or Control. In fact, any selector should start with <code>#{id}</code> to ensure that the query result is limited to the desired Element or Control.
					/// 
					/// <b>Note</b>: there is a convenience method {@link sap.ui.core.Element#getDomRefForSetting} that evaluates the selector in the context of a concrete Element or Control instance. It also handles the placeholder <code>{id}</code>. Only selected framework features may use that private method, it is not yet a public API and might be changed or removed in future versions of UI5. However, instead of maintaining the <code>selector</code> in the metadata, Element and Control classes can overwrite <code>getDomRefForSetting</code> to calculate or add the appropriate DOM Element dynamically.</li> </li> </ul> Aggregation names should use camelCase notation, start with a lowercase letter and only use characters from the set [a-zA-Z0-9_$]. The name for a hidden aggregations might start with an underscore. If an aggregation in the literal is preceded by a JSDoc comment (doclet) and if the UI5 plugin and template are used for JSDoc3 generation, the doclet will be used as generic documentation of the aggregation.
