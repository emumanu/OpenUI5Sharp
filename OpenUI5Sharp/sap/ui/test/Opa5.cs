						/// Available since 1.34.0. An array of functions or Actions or a mixture of both. An action has an 'executeOn' function that will receive a single control as a parameter. If there are multiple actions defined all of them will be executed (first in first out) on each control of, similar to the matchers. Here is one of the most common usages: <code> function (sButtonId) { // executes a Press on a button with a specific id new Opa5().waitFor({ id: sButtonId, actions: new Press() }); }; </code> But actions will only be executed once and only after the check function returned true. Before actions are executed the {@link sap.ui.test.matchers.Interactable} matcher and the internal autoWait logic will check if the Control is currently able to perform actions if it is not, Opa5 will try again after the 'pollingInterval'. That means actions will only be executed if: <ul> <li> Controls and their parents are visible, enabled and not busy </li> <li> The controls are not hidden behind static elements such as dialogs </li> <li> There is no pending asynchronous work performed by the application </li> </ul> If there are multiple controls in Opa5's result set the action will be executed on all of them. The actions will be invoked directly before success is called. In the documentation of the success parameter there is a list of conditions that have to be fulfilled. They also apply for the actions. There are some predefined actions in the {@link sap.ui.test.actions} namespace. since 1.42 an Action may add other waitFors. The next action or the success handler will not be executed until the waitFor of the action has finished. An example: <code> <pre>
						///     this.waitFor({
						///         id: "myButton",
						///         actions: function (oButton) {
						///            // this action is executed first
						///            this.waitFor({
						///              id: "anotherButton",
						///              actions: function () {
						///                // This is the second function that will be executed
						///                // Opa will also wait until anotherButton is Interactable before executing this function
						///              },
						///              success: function () {
						///                // This is the third function that will be executed
						///              }
						///            })
						///         },
						///         success: function () {
						///             // This is the fourth function that will be executed
						///         }
						///     });
						///     </pre> </code> Executing multiple actions will not wait between actions for a control to become "Interactable" again. If you need waiting between actions you need to split the actions into multiple 'waitFor' statements.
						/// </summary>
						public Union<object, object[], sap.ui.test.actions.Action, sap.ui.test.actions.Action[]> actions;

						/// <summary>
						/// @since 1.42 Only has an effect if set to true. Since 1.53 it can also be a plain object. The waitFor statement will not execute success callbacks as long as there is pending asynchronous work such as for example: open XMLHTTPRequests (requests to a server), scheduled delayed work and promises, unfinished UI navigation. In addition, the control must be {@link sap.ui.test.matchers.Interactable} So when autoWait is enabled, success behaves like an action in terms of waiting. It is recommended to set this value to true for all your waitFor statements using: <code> <pre>
						///     Opa5.extendConfig({
						///         autoWait: true
						///     });
						///     </pre> </code> Why is it recommended: When writing a huge set of tests and executing them frequently you might face tests that are sometimes successful but sometimes they are not. Setting the autoWait to true should stabilize most of those tests. The default "false" could not be changed since it causes existing tests to fail. There are cases where you do not want to wait for controls to be "Interactable": For example when you are testing the Busy indication of your UI during the sending of a request. But these cases are the exception so it is better to explicitly adding autoWait: false to this waitFor. <code> <pre>
						///     this.waitFor({
						///         id: "myButton",
						///         autoWait: false,
						///         success: function (oButton) {
						///              Opa5.assert.ok(oButton.getBusy(), "My Button was busy");
						///         }
						///     });
						///     </pre> </code> This is also the easiest way of migrating existing tests. First extend the config, then see which waitFors will time out and finally disable autoWait in these Tests.
