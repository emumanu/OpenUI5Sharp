					/// This method is intended to be called exactly once while the main module of a library (its <code>library.js</code> module) is executing, typically at its begin. The single parameter <code>oLibInfo</code> is an info object that describes the content of the library.
					/// 
					/// When the <code>oLibInfo</code> has been processed, a normalized version of it will be kept and will be returned as library information in later calls to {@link #getLoadedLibraries}. Finally, <code>initLibrary</code> fires (the currently private) {@link #event:LibraryChanged} event with operation 'add' for the newly loaded library.
					/// 
					/// <h3>Side Effects</h3>
					/// 
					/// While analyzing the <code>oLibInfo</code>, the framework takes some additional actions:
					/// 
					/// <ul> <li>If the info object contains a list of <code>interfaces</code>, they will be registered with the {@link sap.ui.base.DataType} class to make them available as aggregation types in managed objects.</li>
					/// 
					/// <li>If the object contains a list of <code>controls</code> or <code>elements</code>, {@link sap.ui.lazyRequire lazy stubs} will be created for their constructor as well as for their static <code>extend</code> and <code>getMetadata</code> methods.<br> <b>Note:</b> Future versions might abandon the concept of lazy stubs as it requires synchronous XMLHttpRequests which have been deprecated (see {@link http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org}). To be on the safe side, productive applications should always require any modules that they directly depend on.</li>
					/// 
					/// <li>With the <code>noLibraryCSS</code> property, the library can be marked as 'theming-free'. Otherwise, the framework will add a &lt;link&gt; tag to the page's head, pointing to the library's theme-specific stylesheet. The creation of such a &lt;link&gt; tag can be suppressed with the {@link sap.ui.core.Configuration global configuration option} <code>preloadLibCss</code>. It can contain a list of library names for which no stylesheet should be included. This is e.g. useful when an application merges the CSS for multiple libraries and already loaded the resulting stylesheet.</li>
					/// 
					/// <li>If a list of library <code>dependencies</code> is specified in the info object, those libraries will be loaded synchronously by <code>initLibrary</code>.<br> <b>Note:</b> Dependencies between libraries don't have to be modeled as AMD dependencies. Only when enums or types from an additional library are used in the coding of the <code>library.js</code> module, the library should be additionally listed in the AMD dependencies.</li> </ul>
					/// 
					/// Last but not least, higher layer frameworks might want to include their own metadata for libraries. The property <code>extensions</code> might contain such additional metadata. Its structure is not defined by the framework, but it is strongly suggested that each extension only occupies a single property in the <code>extensions</code> object and that the name of that property contains some namespace information (e.g. library name that introduces the feature) to avoid conflicts with other extensions. The framework won't touch the content of <code>extensions</code> but will make it available in the library info objects returned by {@link #getLoadedLibraries}.
					/// 
					/// <h3>Relationship to Descriptor for Libraries (manifest.json)</h3>
					/// 
					/// The information contained in <code>oLibInfo</code> is partially redundant to the content of the descriptor for the same library (its <code>manifest.json</code> file).
