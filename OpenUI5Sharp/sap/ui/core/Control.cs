				/// 
				/// Controls provide the following features: <ul> <li><b>Rendering</b>: the <code>RenderManager</code> only expects instances of class <code>Control</code> in its {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#renderControl renderControl} method. By convention, each control class has an associated static class that takes care of rendering the control (its 'Renderer').</li> <li><b>show / hide</b>: a control can be hidden, although it is still part of the control tree, see property {@link #getVisible visible}</li> <li><b>local busy indicator</b>: marks a control visually as 'busy', see properties {@link #getBusy busy} and {@link #getBusyIndicatorDelay busyIndicatorDelay}</li> <li><b>field groups</b>: by assigning the same group ID to a set of editable controls, they form a group which can be validated together. See property {@link #getFieldGroupIds fieldGroupIds} and event {@link #event:validateFieldGroup validateFieldGroup}. The term <i>field</i> was chosen as most often this feature will be used to group editable fields in a form.</li> <li><b>custom style classes</b>: all controls allow to add custom CSS classes to their rendered DOM without modifying their renderer code. See methods {@link #addStyleClass addStyleClass}, {@link #removeStyleClass removeStyleClass}, {@link #toggleStyleClass toggleStyleClass} and {@link #hasStyleClass hasStyleClass}.</br> The necessary implementation is encapsulated in {@link sap.ui.core.CustomStyleClassSupport CustomStyleClassSupport} and can be applied to selected element classes as well.</li> <li><b>browser events</b>: by calling the methods {@link #attachBrowserEvent attachBrowserEvent} and {@link #detachBrowserEvent detachBrowserEvent}, consumers can let the control class take care of registering / de-registering a given set of event listeners to the control's root DOM node. The framework will adapt the registration whenever the DOM node changes (e.g. before or after rendering or when the control is destroyed).</li> </ul>
