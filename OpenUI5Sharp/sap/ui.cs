			///

			/// 
			/// It is best practice to omit the name of the defined module (first parameter) and to use relative names for the dependencies whenever possible. This reduces the necessary configuration, simplifies renaming of packages and allows to map them to a different namespace.
			/// 
			/// <h3>Dependency to Modules</h3>
			/// 
			/// If a dependencies array is given, each entry represents the name of another module that the currently defined module depends on. All dependency modules are loaded before the export of the currently defined module is determined. The module export of each dependency module will be provided as a parameter to a factory function, the order of the parameters will match the order of the modules in the dependencies array.
			/// 
			/// <b>Note:</b> The order in which the dependency modules are <i>executed</i> is <b>not</b> defined by the order in the dependencies array! The execution order is affected by dependencies <i>between</i> the dependency modules as well as by their current state (whether a module already has been loaded or not). Neither module implementations nor dependents that require a module set must make any assumption about the execution order (other than expressed by their dependencies).
			/// 
			/// <b>Note:</b> A static module export (a literal provided to <code>sap.ui.define</code>) cannot depend on the module exports of the dependency modules as it has to be calculated before the dependencies are resolved. As an alternative, modules can define a factory function, calculate a static export value in that function, potentially based on the dependencies, and return the result as module export value. The same approach must be taken when the module export is supposed to be a function.
			/// 
			/// <h3>Asynchronous Contract</h3>
			/// 
			/// <code>sap.ui.define</code> is designed to support real Asynchronous Module Definitions (AMD) in future, although it internally still might use synchronous module loading, depending on configuration and context. However, callers of <code>sap.ui.define</code> must never rely on any synchronous behavior that they might observe in a specific test scenario.
			/// 
			/// For example, callers of <code>sap.ui.define</code> must not use the module export value immediately after invoking <code>sap.ui.define</code>:
			/// 
			/// <pre>
			///   // COUNTER EXAMPLE HOW __NOT__ TO DO IT
			/// 
			///   // define a class Something as AMD module
			///   sap.ui.define('Something', [], function() {
			///     var Something = function() {};
			///     return Something;
			///   });
			/// 
			///   // DON'T DO THAT!
			///   // accessing the class _synchronously_ after sap.ui.define was called
			///   new Something();
			/// 
			/// </pre>
			/// 
			/// Applications that need to ensure synchronous module definition or synchronous loading of dependencies <b>MUST</b> use the deprecated legacy APIs {@link jQuery.sap.declare} and {@link jQuery.sap.require}.
			/// 
			/// <h3>(No) Global References</h3>
			/// 
			/// To be in line with AMD best practices, modules defined with <code>sap.ui.define</code> should not make any use of global variables if those variables are also available as module exports. Instead, they should add dependencies to those modules and use the corresponding parameter of the factory function to access the module exports.
			/// 
			/// As the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel to the old global names. The fourth parameter of <code>sap.ui.define</code> has been added to support that transition phase. When this parameter is set to true, the framework provides two additional features
			/// 
			/// <ol> <li>Before the factory function is called, the existence of the global parent namespace for the current module is ensured</li> <li>The module export returned by the module's factory function will be automatically exported under the global name which is derived from the ID of the module</li> </ol>
			/// 
			/// The parameter lets the framework know whether any of those two operations is needed or not. In future versions of UI5, a central configuration option is planned to suppress those 'exports'.
			/// 
			/// <h3>Third Party Modules</h3> Although third party modules don't use UI5 APIs, they still can be listed as dependencies in a <code>sap.ui.define</code> call. They will be requested and executed like UI5 modules, but to make their exports available, so called <em>shims</em> have to be defined.
			/// 
			/// Note that UI5 temporarily deactivates an existing AMD loader while it executes third party modules known to support AMD. This sounds contradictorily at a first glance as UI5 wants to support AMD, but for now it is necessary to fully support UI5 applications that rely on global names for such modules.
			/// 
			/// For third-party modules that UI5 delivers (e.g. those in namespace <code>sap/ui/thirdparty/</code>), the necessary shims are defined by UI5 itself by executing the private module <code>ui5loader-autoconfig.js</code> during bootstrap.
			/// 
			/// Example: <pre>
			///   // module 'Something' wants to use third party library 'URI.js'
			///   // It is packaged by UI5 as non-UI5-module 'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'
			///   // the following shim helps UI5 to correctly load URI.js and to retrieve the module's export value
			///   // Apps don't have to define that shim, it is already applied by ui5loader-autconfig.js
			///   sap.ui.loader.config({
			///     shim: {
			///       'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI': {
			///          amd: true, // URI.js reacts on an AMD loader, this flag lets UI5 temp. disable such loaders
			///          exports: 'URI' // name of the global variable under which URI.js exports its module value
			///       }
			///     }
			///   });
			/// 
			///   // now the module can be retrieved like other modules
			///   sap.ui.define('Something', ['sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'], function(URIModuleValue) {
			/// 
			///     new URIModuleValue(...); // same as the global 'URI' name: new URI(...)
			/// 
			///     ...
			///   });
			/// </pre>
			/// 
			/// <h3>Differences to Standard AMD</h3>
			/// 
			/// The current implementation of <code>sap.ui.define</code> differs from the AMD specification (https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api) or from concrete AMD loaders like <code>requireJS</code> in several aspects: <ul> <li>The name <code>sap.ui.define</code> is different from the plain <code>define</code>. This has two reasons: first, it avoids the impression that <code>sap.ui.define</code> is an exact implementation of an AMD loader. And second, it allows the coexistence of an AMD loader (e.g. requireJS) and <code>sap.ui.define</code> in one application as long as UI5 or applications using UI5 are not fully prepared to run with an AMD loader. Note that the difference of the API names also implies that the UI5 loader can't be used to load 'real' AMD modules as they expect methods <code>define</code> and <code>require</code> to be available. Modules that use Unified Module Definition (UMD) syntax, can be loaded, but only when no AMD loader is present or when they expose their export also to the global namespace, even when an AMD loader is present (as e.g. jQuery does) or when a shim is defined for them using the <code>amd:true</code> flag (see example above)</li> <li>Depending on configuration and the current context, <code>sap.ui.define</code> loads the dependencies of a module either synchronously using a sync XHR call + eval or asynchronously via script tags. The sync loading is basically a tribute to the synchronous history of UI5. There's no way for a module developer to enforce synchronous loading of the dependencies and on the long run, sync loading will be faded out. Applications that need to ensure synchronous loading of dependencies <b>MUST</b> use the deprecated legacy APIs like {@link jQuery.sap.require}.</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does not support plugins to use other file types, formats or protocols. It is not planned to support this in future</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does not support absolute URLs as module names (dependencies) nor does it allow module names that start with a slash. To refer to a module at an absolute URL, a resource root can be registered that points to that URL (or to a prefix of it).</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does <b>not</b> support the 'sugar' of requireJS where CommonJS style dependency declarations using <code>sap.ui.require("something")</code> are automagically converted into <code>sap.ui.define</code> dependencies before executing the factory function.</li> </ul>
			/// 
			/// <h3>Limitations, Design Considerations</h3> <ul> <li><b>Limitation</b>: as dependency management is not supported for Non-UI5 modules, the only way to ensure proper execution order for such modules currently is to rely on the order in the dependency array. Obviously, this only works as long as <code>sap.ui.define</code> uses synchronous loading. It will be enhanced when asynchronous loading is implemented.</li> <li>It was discussed to enforce asynchronous execution of the module factory function (e.g. with a timeout of 0). But this would have invalidated the current migration scenario where a sync <code>jQuery.sap.require</code> call can load a <code>sap.ui.define</code>'ed module. If the module definition would not execute synchronously, the synchronous contract of the require call would be broken (default behavior in existing UI5 applications)</li> <li>A single file must not contain multiple calls to <code>sap.ui.define</code>. Multiple calls currently are only supported in the so called 'preload' files that the UI5 merge tooling produces. The exact details of how this works might be changed in future implementations and are not part of the API contract</li> </ul>

This has two reasons: first, it avoids the impression that <code>sap.ui.define</code> is an exact implementation of an AMD loader. And second, it allows the coexistence of an AMD loader (e.g. requireJS) and <code>sap.ui.define</code> in one application as long as UI5 or applications using UI5 are not fully prepared to run with an AMD loader. Note that the difference of the API names also implies that the UI5 loader can't be used to load 'real' AMD modules as they expect methods <code>define</code> and <code>require</code> to be available. Modules that use Unified Module Definition (UMD) syntax, can be loaded, but only when no AMD loader is present or when they expose their export also to the global namespace, even when an AMD loader is present (as e.g. jQuery does) or when a shim is defined for them using the <code>amd:true</code> flag (see example above)</li> <li>Depending on configuration and the current context, <code>sap.ui.define</code> loads the dependencies of a module either synchronously using a sync XHR call + eval or asynchronously via script tags. The sync loading is basically a tribute to the synchronous history of UI5. There's no way for a module developer to enforce synchronous loading of the dependencies and on the long run, sync loading will be faded out. Applications that need to ensure synchronous loading of dependencies <b>MUST</b> use the deprecated legacy APIs like {@link jQuery.sap.require}.</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does not support plugins to use other file types, formats or protocols. It is not planned to support this in future</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does not support absolute URLs as module names (dependencies) nor does it allow module names that start with a slash. To refer to a module at an absolute URL, a resource root can be registered that points to that URL (or to a prefix of it).</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does <b>not</b> support the 'sugar' of requireJS where CommonJS style dependency declarations using <code>sap.ui.require("something")</code> are automagically converted into <code>sap.ui.define</code> dependencies before executing the factory function.</li> </ul>

Both methods always add this extension internally.
			///

			/// 
			/// It is best practice to omit the name of the defined module (first parameter) and to use relative names for the dependencies whenever possible. This reduces the necessary configuration, simplifies renaming of packages and allows to map them to a different namespace.
			/// 
			/// <h3>Dependency to Modules</h3>
			/// 
			/// If a dependencies array is given, each entry represents the name of another module that the currently defined module depends on. All dependency modules are loaded before the export of the currently defined module is determined. The module export of each dependency module will be provided as a parameter to a factory function, the order of the parameters will match the order of the modules in the dependencies array.
			/// 
			/// <b>Note:</b> The order in which the dependency modules are <i>executed</i> is <b>not</b> defined by the order in the dependencies array! The execution order is affected by dependencies <i>between</i> the dependency modules as well as by their current state (whether a module already has been loaded or not). Neither module implementations nor dependents that require a module set must make any assumption about the execution order (other than expressed by their dependencies).
			/// 
			/// <b>Note:</b> A static module export (a literal provided to <code>sap.ui.define</code>) cannot depend on the module exports of the dependency modules as it has to be calculated before the dependencies are resolved. As an alternative, modules can define a factory function, calculate a static export value in that function, potentially based on the dependencies, and return the result as module export value.

			/// 
			/// <h3>Asynchronous Contract</h3>
			/// 
			/// <code>sap.ui.define</code> is designed to support real Asynchronous Module Definitions (AMD) in future, although it internally still might use synchronous module loading, depending on configuration and context. However, callers of <code>sap.ui.define</code> must never rely on any synchronous behavior that they might observe in a specific test scenario.
			/// 
			/// For example, callers of <code>sap.ui.define</code> must not use the module export value immediately after invoking <code>sap.ui.define</code>:

			///

			/// 
			/// To be in line with AMD best practices, modules defined with <code>sap.ui.define</code> should not make any use of global variables if those variables are also available as module exports.

			/// 
			/// As the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel to the old global names. The fourth parameter of <code>sap.ui.define</code> has been added to support that transition phase. When this parameter is set to true, the framework provides two additional features
			/// 
			/// <ol> <li>Before the factory function is called, the existence of the global parent namespace for the current module is ensured</li> <li>The module export returned by the module's factory function will be automatically exported under the global name which is derived from the ID of the module</li> </ol>

The execution order is affected by dependencies <i>between</i> the dependency modules as well as by their current state (whether a module already has been loaded or not). Neither module implementations nor dependents that require a module set must make any assumption about the execution order (other than expressed by their dependencies).
			/// 
			/// <b>Note:</b> A static module export (a literal provided to <code>sap.ui.define</code>) cannot depend on the module exports of the dependency modules as it has to be calculated before the dependencies are resolved.

			/// 
			/// To be in line with AMD best practices, modules defined with <code>sap.ui.define</code> should not make any use of global variables if those variables are also available as module exports. Instead, they should add dependencies to those modules and use the corresponding parameter of the factory function to access the module exports.
			/// 
			/// As the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel to the old global names. The fourth parameter of <code>sap.ui.define</code> has been added to support that transition phase. When this parameter is set to true, the framework provides two additional features
			/// 
			/// <ol> <li>Before the factory function is called, the existence of the global parent namespace for the current module is ensured</li> <li>The module export returned by the module's factory function will be automatically exported under the global name which is derived from the ID of the module</li> </ol>
			/// 
			/// The parameter lets the framework know whether any of those two operations is needed or not. In future versions of UI5, a central configuration option is planned to suppress those 'exports'.
			/// 
			/// <h3>Third Party Modules</h3> Although third party modules don't use UI5 APIs, they still can be listed as dependencies in a <code>sap.ui.define</code> call. They will be requested and executed like UI5 modules, but to make their exports available, so called <em>shims</em> have to be defined.
			/// 
			/// Note that UI5 temporarily deactivates an existing AMD loader while it executes third party modules known to support AMD. This sounds contradictorily at a first glance as UI5 wants to support AMD, but for now it is necessary to fully support UI5 applications that rely on global names for such modules.
			/// 
			/// For third-party modules that UI5 delivers (e.g. those in namespace <code>sap/ui/thirdparty/</code>), the necessary shims are defined by UI5 itself by executing the private module <code>ui5loader-autoconfig.js</code> during bootstrap.
			/// 
			/// Example: <pre>
			///   // module 'Something' wants to use third party library 'URI.js'
			///   // It is packaged by UI5 as non-UI5-module 'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'
			///   // the following shim helps UI5 to correctly load URI.js and to retrieve the module's export value
			///   // Apps don't have to define that shim, it is already applied by ui5loader-autconfig.js
			///   sap.ui.loader.config({
			///     shim: {
			///       'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI': {
			///          amd: true, // URI.js reacts on an AMD loader, this flag lets UI5 temp. disable such loaders
			///          exports: 'URI' // name of the global variable under which URI.js exports its module value
			///       }
			///     }

			/// The current implementation of <code>sap.ui.define</code> differs from the AMD specification (https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api) or from concrete AMD loaders like <code>requireJS</code> in several aspects: <ul> <li>The name <code>sap.ui.define</code> is different from the plain <code>define</code>. This has two reasons: first, it avoids the impression that <code>sap.ui.define</code> is an exact implementation of an AMD loader. And second, it allows the coexistence of an AMD loader (e.g. requireJS) and <code>sap.ui.define</code> in one application as long as UI5 or applications using UI5 are not fully prepared to run with an AMD loader. Note that the difference of the API names also implies that the UI5 loader can't be used to load 'real' AMD modules as they expect methods <code>define</code> and <code>require</code> to be available. Modules that use Unified Module Definition (UMD) syntax, can be loaded, but only when no AMD loader is present or when they expose their export also to the global namespace, even when an AMD loader is present (as e.g. jQuery does) or when a shim is defined for them using the <code>amd:true</code> flag (see example above)</li> <li>Depending on configuration and the current context, <code>sap.ui.define</code> loads the dependencies of a module either synchronously using a sync XHR call + eval or asynchronously via script tags. The sync loading is basically a tribute to the synchronous history of UI5. There's no way for a module developer to enforce synchronous loading of the dependencies and on the long run, sync loading will be faded out. Applications that need to ensure synchronous loading of dependencies <b>MUST</b> use the deprecated legacy APIs like {@link jQuery.sap.require}.</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does not support plugins to use other file types, formats or protocols. It is not planned to support this in future</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does not support absolute URLs as module names (dependencies) nor does it allow module names that start with a slash.

			/// <h3>Differences to Standard AMD</h3>
			/// 
			/// The current implementation of <code>sap.ui.define</code> differs from the AMD specification (https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api) or from concrete AMD loaders like <code>requireJS</code> in several aspects: <ul> <li>The name <code>sap.ui.define</code> is different from the plain <code>define</code>. This has two reasons: first, it avoids the impression that <code>sap.ui.define</code> is an exact implementation of an AMD loader. And second, it allows the coexistence of an AMD loader (e.g. requireJS) and <code>sap.ui.define</code> in one application as long as UI5 or applications using UI5 are not fully prepared to run with an AMD loader. Note that the difference of the API names also implies that the UI5 loader can't be used to load 'real' AMD modules as they expect methods <code>define</code> and <code>require</code> to be available. Modules that use Unified Module Definition (UMD) syntax, can be loaded, but only when no AMD loader is present or when they expose their export also to the global namespace, even when an AMD loader is present (as e.g. jQuery does) or when a shim is defined for them using the <code>amd:true</code> flag (see example above)</li> <li>Depending on configuration and the current context, <code>sap.ui.define</code> loads the dependencies of a module either synchronously using a sync XHR call + eval or asynchronously via script tags. The sync loading is basically a tribute to the synchronous history of UI5. There's no way for a module developer to enforce synchronous loading of the dependencies and on the long run, sync loading will be faded out. Applications that need to ensure synchronous loading of dependencies <b>MUST</b> use the deprecated legacy APIs like {@link jQuery.sap.require}.</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does not support plugins to use other file types, formats or protocols. It is not planned to support this in future</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does not support absolute URLs as module names (dependencies) nor does it allow module names that start with a slash. To refer to a module at an absolute URL, a resource root can be registered that points to that URL (or to a prefix of it).</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does <b>not</b> support the 'sugar' of requireJS where CommonJS style dependency declarations using <code>sap.ui.require("something")</code> are automagically converted into <code>sap.ui.define</code> dependencies before executing the factory function.</li> </ul>
			/// 
			/// <h3>Limitations, Design Considerations</h3> <ul> <li><b>Limitation</b>: as dependency management is not supported for Non-UI5 modules, the only way to ensure proper execution order for such modules currently is to rely on the order in the dependency array. Obviously, this only works as long as <code>sap.ui.define</code> uses synchronous loading. It will be enhanced when asynchronous loading is implemented.</li> <li>It was discussed to enforce asynchronous execution of the module factory function (e.g. with a timeout of 0). But this would have invalidated the current migration scenario where a sync <code>jQuery.sap.require</code> call can load a <code>sap.ui.define</code>'ed module. If the module definition would not execute synchronously, the synchronous contract of the require call would be broken (default behavior in existing UI5 applications)</li> <li>A single file must not contain multiple calls to <code>sap.ui.define</code>. Multiple calls currently are only supported in the so called 'preload' files that the UI5 merge tooling produces. The exact details of how this works might be changed in future implementations and are not part of the API contract</li> </ul>

			/// 
			/// The typical and only suggested usage of this method is to have one single, top level call to <code>sap.ui.define</code> in one JavaScript resource (file). When a module is requested by its module ID for the first time, the corresponding resource is determined from the ID and the current {@link sap.ui.loader.config configuration}. The resource will be loaded and executed which in turn will execute the top level <code>sap.ui.define</code> call.
			/// 
			/// If the module ID was omitted from that call, it will be substituted by the ID that was used to request the module. As a preparation step, the dependencies as well as their transitive dependencies, will be loaded. Then, the module value (its export) will be determined: if a static value (object, literal) was given as <code>vFactory</code>, that value will be the module value. If a function was given, that function will be called (providing the module exports of the declared dependencies as parameters to the function) and its return value will be used as module export value.

The given controller instance overrides the controller defined in the view definition</li> <li>The view type <code>vView.type</code> specifies what kind of view will be instantiated. All valid view types are listed in the enumeration sap.ui.core.mvc.ViewType.</li> <li>The view data <code>vView.viewData</code> can hold user specific data. This data is available during the whole lifecycle of the view and the controller</li> <li>The view loading mode <code>vView.async</code> must be a boolean and defines if the view source is loaded synchronously or asynchronously. In async mode, the view is rendered empty initially, and re-rendered with the loaded view content.</li> <li><code>vView.preprocessors</code></li> can hold a map from the specified preprocessor type (e.g. "xml") to an array of preprocessor configurations; each configuration consists of a <code>preprocessor</code> property (optional when registered as on-demand preprocessor) and may contain further preprocessor-specific settings. The preprocessor can be either a module name as string implementation of {@link sap.ui.core.mvc.View.Preprocessor} or a function according to {@link sap.ui.core.mvc.View.Preprocessor.process}. Do not set properties starting with underscore like <code>_sProperty</code> property, these are reserved for internal purposes. When several preprocessors are provided for one hook, it has to be made sure that they do not conflict when being processed serially.
